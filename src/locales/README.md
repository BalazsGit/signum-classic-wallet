# Translations
The community can help adding or making translations more complete and accurate!

## How to help
**Do no edit the json files!** They are created automatically from the file 'translations.csv' by running the script `updateFiles.sh`
* Use your spreadsheet program to import the csv file
* Use the filters and hide columns not needed
* Complete the missing translations.
* Do not use double quotes `"` in translations. If needed use single quotes `'` or other unicode character for quoting text.
* Avoid to use backslash `\` to escape any char. Prefer use HTML escaped codes. Escaped backlash where needed: `\\n` to newline. 
* Save the csv in UTF-8 format, using comma `,` as field separator and adding double quotes `"` as text delimiter.
